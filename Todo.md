~~-distributions and model are kind of an arbitrary distinction as both emit a LogProb, think about unifying the concepts
    -model composition of initial values and a loop over logprobs?~~
~~- add 8 schools example to~~ 
~~- reduce Callables to more expressive abstractions for better type checking~~
~~- check how to abstract the processes involved more clearly~~
- check how to conceptualize some type of model class that is recursive for hierachical structures
  - think about context manager vs builder pattern
    ~~- propagate new types to the rest of the code!~~
- check about warmup and num_steps
