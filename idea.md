# Project Proposal: A Context-Aware Bayesian Workflow Framework Based on BlackJAX

## Executive Summary

This proposal outlines the development of a novel Bayesian modeling framework that builds upon BlackJAX with a specific focus on the conceptualization and integration of data within probabilistic models. The framework reframes data handling through a causal lens, viewing observed data as the result of forward simulations from prior distributions rather than as static inputs. This approach enables a unified, seamless workflow for Bayesian modeling practices, including prior elicitation, prior predictive checks, inference, and posterior predictive checks, all while maintaining conceptual clarity and minimizing dependencies on external libraries.

## Background and Motivation

Current Bayesian frameworks often treat data as passive inputs to probabilistic models, which creates a conceptual disconnect between model specification and data generation. This disconnect frequently manifests as fragmented workflows where practitioners must switch between different libraries and paradigms when moving from model specification to prior simulation, to inference, and finally to model checking. The result is often cognitive overhead and potentially error-prone transitions between these phases.

BlackJAX provides excellent low-level primitives for Bayesian inference, but lacks a higher-level API that unifies the entire Bayesian workflow. By reconceptualizing how data interacts with probabilistic models, we can create a more coherent and intuitive framework that naturally accommodates the iterative nature of Bayesian modeling.

## Key Innovation: Data as Forward Simulation

The central innovation of this framework is the re-conceptualization of data not as static observations but as the product of forward simulations from priors. Specifically:

1. **Data Function Concept**: Data is represented as a function (`data_fn`) that encapsulates the causal relationships between model parameters and observations.

2. **Context Awareness**: This `data_fn` automatically adapts to different phases of the Bayesian workflow:
   - In prior predictive checking, it generates synthetic data from prior distributions
   - During inference, it provides access to observed data
   - For posterior predictive checking, it generates new data conditioned on posterior samples

3. **Unified Interface**: By maintaining a consistent interface across all phases, the framework creates a natural flow from model specification to inference to model validation.

## Technical Approach

The framework will be implemented in JAX with BlackJAX as the core inference engine. The design comprises several key components:

### Core Components

1. **Context-Aware Data Functions**: Functions that adaptively handle data generation or retrieval based on the current modeling phase (prior predictive, inference, or posterior predictive).

2. **Probabilistic Model Class**: A class that encapsulates the complete model specification, including priors, likelihood, and data functions, with methods for each phase of the Bayesian workflow.

3. **Builder Pattern Implementation**: A fluent API for constructing models in a declarative style that separates concerns of data handling, prior specification, and likelihood definition.

### Technical Implementation Details

The framework will include:

1. **Type System**: A comprehensive set of type aliases and protocols to ensure type safety and enable IDE intellisense support.

2. **Parameter Handling**: Utilities for flattening and unflattening structured parameters to interface with BlackJAX's expectation of flat parameter arrays.

3. **BlackJAX Integration**: Seamless integration with BlackJAX samplers, particularly NUTS with warmup, while abstracting away the boilerplate typically associated with setting up inference.

4. **Automatic Context Detection**: Intelligence built into the framework to determine the appropriate mode of operation based on available information (e.g., presence of observed data or posterior samples).

## Expected Benefits

This framework offers several advantages over existing approaches:

1. **Conceptual Clarity**: By framing data as the result of a forward generative process, the framework aligns with how scientists conceptualize the relationship between models and observations.

2. **Workflow Coherence**: Users can transition smoothly between different phases of Bayesian modeling without breaking their conceptual flow or importing multiple libraries.

3. **Reproducibility**: The unification of data generation and model specification ensures that the entire process from prior specification to posterior analysis is self-contained and reproducible.

4. **Efficiency**: The framework minimizes redundant code and eliminates the need to reformulate models when transitioning between workflow phases.

## Research Questions

The development of this framework will explore several important research questions:

1. How does explicitly viewing data as a forward simulation impact the practice of Bayesian modeling?

2. Can a unified conceptual framework reduce errors and improve efficiency in the Bayesian workflow?

3. What are the computational implications of maintaining a consistent interface across different phases of Bayesian modeling?

4. How does this approach scale to complex hierarchical models and high-dimensional data?

## Deliverables

1. **Core Framework Implementation**: A Python package implementing the described framework.

2. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation and tutorials demonstrating the framework's use.

3. **Case Studies**: Implementation of several canonical Bayesian models (e.g., hierarchical models, time series models) using the framework.

4. **Performance Analysis**: Benchmarks comparing the framework to existing approaches in terms of both computational efficiency and developer productivity.

## Timeline

- **Month 1**: Design and implementation of core data function abstractions and model builder pattern
- **Month 2**: Integration with BlackJAX and implementation of context-aware behavior
- **Month 3**: Development of case studies and performance analysis
- **Month 4**: Documentation, testing, and refinement based on user feedback

## Required Resources

- Access to computing resources for benchmark testing
- JAX and BlackJAX library expertise
- Knowledge of Bayesian statistics and probabilistic programming
- Software engineering skills for implementing clean, maintainable abstractions

## Conclusion

The proposed framework represents a significant conceptual advance in Bayesian workflow design. By reconceptualizing data as the output of forward simulations rather than static inputs, we create a more natural and unified approach to Bayesian modeling. This has the potential to improve both the efficiency and correctness of Bayesian analyses while providing a more intuitive interface for practitioners. Building on the solid foundation of BlackJAX, this framework will offer a higher-level API that maintains computational efficiency while significantly improving usability and conceptual clarity.
